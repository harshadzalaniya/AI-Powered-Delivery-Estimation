# AI Powered Delivery Time Estimator
## AI-Based Application for Estimating Delivery Time in Days
## Overview
This project is an AI-based application built entirely with Python, designed to estimate delivery times in days. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and historical data, the application provides accurate predictions to enhance logistics and supply chain management.

## Features
* Estimates delivery time in days based on historical data and machine learning algorithms
* Utilizes Python's extensive libraries, including scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy
* Scalable and adaptable to various logistical scenarios

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* NumPy
* joblib

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Delivery-Time-Estimator.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset: Create a CSV file named `delivery_data.csv` with columns `distance`, `package_weight`, and `delivery_time`.
2. Train the model: `python train.py`
3. Make predictions: `python predict.py`
